# [Heroku Go Base Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/heroku/go)

This is a base image that includes the Go toolchain. You probably don't want/need to use this by itself and should probably use either [heroku/go](https://hub.docker.com/r/heroku/go) or [heroku/go-gb](https://hub.docker.com/r/heroku/go-gb)

## Image tags

You can see all of the tags [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/heroku/go-base/tags/).

The `latest` tag will generally refer to the latest, possibly unsupported,
release of [Go](https://golang.org/dl), including betas and release candidates.

There is one tag per major version of go (1.4, 1.5, 1.6, etc).
These will be updated to the latest version as new versions of that major series are released.
